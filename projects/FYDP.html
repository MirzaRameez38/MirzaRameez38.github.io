          <h2>About This Project</h2>
          <p>Neutron stars are among the most amazing and extreme objects in space. They are very dense and have strong magnetic fields and spin very fast. It's hard to imagine them just by reading books. Our project is an interactive 3D simulation that helps you explore and understand these complex objects. You can change their size, heat, magnetic field, and how fast they spin to see what happens.</p>
          <p>This tool is for students, teachers, and anyone who loves astronomy. It makes learning about neutron stars easier and more fun by letting you see and interact with them in a virtual world. It also helps scientists test their ideas and understand real observations better.</p>

      <h2>The Problem We Solved</h2>
      <p>Learning about neutron stars can be very difficult. Textbooks often use only words and diagrams, which don't show how dynamic and extreme these stars really are. This makes it hard for students to truly grasp ideas like their super density, strong magnetic fields, or fast spinning. Our simulation was created to break this barrier, offering a clear and engaging way to learn.</p>

      <h2>My Work & What I Did</h2>
      <p>As a key member of Group Number 10 for this Final Year Project, my main role was in <strong>creating and developing the core simulation model</strong> of the neutron star.</p>
      <p>My responsibilities included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Making sure the 3D neutron star model was <strong>scientifically accurate</strong> in its shape and details.</li>
        <li>Setting up the <strong>main physics rules</strong> for the star, like its size, heat, magnetic field, and how fast it spins, making sure they matched real-world theories.</li>
        <li>Working a lot on <strong>visual effects</strong> using Shader Graph. This included making the star's color change based on its temperature (like a hot stove changing color) and showing magnetic fields using cool particle effects.</li>
        <li>Writing the <strong>code for the simulation's physics</strong>, so that when users change settings, the star reacts correctly and instantly.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>My team members also played vital roles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Muhammad Saad Siddiqui:</strong> Focused on the technical setup in Unity (like Universal Render Pipeline for performance), making the visuals look realistic (skybox, lighting), and creating interactive camera controls.</li>
        <li><strong>Syed Sameer Ali:</strong> Managed the project's workflow, created the step-by-step development plan, and designed the user interface (UI) within Unity, including all the main menus and buttons.</li>
        <li><strong>Nabiha Hameed:</strong> Led the research part, collecting deep information about neutron stars to make sure our simulation was scientifically correct, and helped write the final report.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Together, our team turned complex science into a fun, educational, and accurate simulation.</p>

      <div class="implementation-content">
        <h3>Building the Simulation</h3>
        <p>This interactive 3D simulation was built using <strong>Unity 3D</strong>, which is a powerful platform for real-time graphics. We used <strong>C#</strong> as the programming language. The Universal Render Pipeline (URP) was used for optimized graphics.</p>
        <p>The core logic involves updating the neutron star's appearance and behavior based on user input. For example, here's a simplified look at how the camera is controlled in the simulation:</p>
        <div class="code-snippet">
          <pre><code class="language-csharp">
// Simplified Camera Controller Script in Unity (C#)
public class CameraController : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform target; // The object to orbit around (our Neutron Star)
    public float distance = 50f; // How far the camera is from the star
    public float orbitSpeed = 10f; // Speed of orbiting with mouse

    private float currentX = 0f;
    private float currentY = 0f;

    void Start()
    {
        // Find the neutron star if not set
        if (target == null && GameObject.Find("NeutronStar") != null)
        {
            target = GameObject.Find("NeutronStar").transform;
        }
        // Set initial camera angles
        Vector3 angles = transform.eulerAngles;
        currentX = angles.y;
        currentY = angles.x;
    }

    void LateUpdate()
    {
        if (target == null) return;

        // Handle mouse input for orbiting
        if (Input.GetMouseButton(1)) // Right mouse button
        {
            currentX += Input.GetAxis("Mouse X") * orbitSpeed;
            currentY -= Input.GetAxis("Mouse Y") * orbitSpeed;
            currentY = Mathf.Clamp(currentY, -80f, 80f); // Limit vertical movement
        }

        // Calculate camera position and rotation
        Vector3 dir = new Vector3(0, 0, -distance);
        Quaternion rotation = Quaternion.Euler(currentY, currentX, 0);
        transform.position = target.position + rotation * dir;
        transform.rotation = rotation;
    }

    // Other functions for arrow key movement and zoom (as in your report)
    // ...
}
